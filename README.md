# Initiatives
Welcome to the MADE's initiatives page! This document will outline big, public-facing proposals related to the museum's work.

# Mission
**Inspire the next generation of digital creators through playable preservation.**

We differentiate ourselves from other institutions in our belief that the playable experience of video games and other artifacts must be interactive to be fully understood. To that end, our organization actively explores the spectrum of playable preservation by using all available methods to create our exhibit experience.

# Volunteering Opportunities
The MADE is always looking for volunteers! From teaching our free game development classes, working on our website, maintaining our exhibits, and bringing the MADE's collection into the community, we've got so much for you to work on. If you're interested, jump over to our project board: [Project Board Here!](https://github.com/orgs/Museum-of-Art-and-Digital-Entertainment/projects/14).
For more info, check out our documentation on how to navigate the volunteering opportunities at the MADE: [Volunteering Documentation](https://github.com/Museum-of-Art-and-Digital-Entertainment/MADE-Initiatives/blob/main/getting_involved.md)
You can also take a look at some of our key programs below; all of these need support, and we're happy to provide you with information you need to get started! All opportunities for these programs are listed in the project link above.

# Committees
To effectively distribute our work, we have four primary committees that work alongside a general operations committee. These committees are as follows: Museum, Community, Education, and Store. 

- Museum: Maintain and catalog a collection used to produce educational and entertaining playable exhibits at a rapid pace.
- Community: Encourage the gathering of individuals interested in digital expression to learn from one another and create a safe, welcoming space.
- Education: Educate the next generation of digital creators through the critical analysis and creation of digital entertainment media.
- Store: Provide a vehicle for individuals to support the museumâ€™s services while capturing their costs and impact.

# Major Board Initiatives
Many boards approach capacity building by funding a large budget at first. Historically, the museum isn't good at this but, rather, producing value for individuals within community and using that budget to fund the operations of the museum. The museum attracts builders, designers, and people who build and ship real world products.

While this is a weakness, it is also an incredible strength. If we focus, we can build upon our track record of delivering to improve upon the quality of our work and grow budget through the systematic improvement of process.

Instead of attempting to address all of the different product SKUs and/or focus on big fundraising events, we are going to put our heads down and focus on two goals that will allow us to plan and deploy increasingly engaging events through visual communication, improvement of process, and transparency of costs and impact.

Are you a professional working in education, the digital entertainment industry, or a leader in your field of work/study and want to be a part of this? Reach out to info@themade.org for more information. While we don't ask for board membership fees, we are a ***working board***. We will expect a number of hours from you every week and regular attendance at committee meetings, but you will have the chance to meet other seasoned professionals, learn something from them, and be able to point at a physical location and numbers that demonstrate your ability to make real world impact.

# Financial Sustainability
Currently, the museum is sustained by a few core donors who fill in financial gaps left over from operational income; our goal is to overcome the gap at the current level of staffing and support a full-time executive director and a team that scales proportionally with the programs that generate profit through their operations. In order to reach this goal within the next two years, the museum must increase revenue by 40% YoY. While ambitious, we believe this target will highlight our need to better communicate, design, and provide programming that appeals to everyone within our community.

# Educational Field Trip Growth
In line with our mission to inspire the next generation of digital creators through playable preservation, we aim to increase the number of students engaging with our collection through field trips, workshops, and tours. Through field trips, we can provide a different perspective into the world of video games as a lens to explore audio design, interaction design, computer graphics, mathematics, and so much more. To that end, we aim to increase the number of students admitted to our museum in our field trip program by 40% YoY for the next two years.

## Support of Below the Line Programs
Depending on committee membership, you may instead be tasked with supporting the system development and evaluation of key museum programs. The key programs can be found below. These items should be considered as products of the museum, and all products need constant attention to be maintained and relevant.
